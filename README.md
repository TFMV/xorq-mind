# xorg-mind

A collection of examples and resources for exploring the xorq data framework and its capabilities.

## Project Structure

- `pipelines/`: A collection of minimal, expressive pipeline examples demonstrating the key capabilities of xorq
  - `multi_engine/`: Examples of xorq's ability to work across multiple execution engines
  - `python_udfs/`: Demonstrations of User-Defined Functions in xorq pipelines
  - `ml_pipelines/`: Machine learning pipelines leveraging xorq's deferred execution and Arrow integration
  - `yaml_serialization/`: Examples of serializing and deserializing pipelines for reproducibility
  - `datasets/`: Sample datasets used by the examples
- `art/`: Medium article and supporting artifacts (coming)

## Key Features Demonstrated

1. **Deferred computation model** - Define pipelines declaratively, execute when needed
2. **Multi-engine execution** - Seamlessly move data between different engines (DuckDB, Snowflake, Python)
3. **Declarative pipeline definition** - Express pipelines in Python or YAML
4. **Expression serialization** - Serialize pipelines for reproducibility across environments
5. **Apache Arrow integration** - Leverage Arrow for high-performance data transfer
6. **Built-in caching** - Automatically cache intermediate results
7. **ML integration** - Use UDFs across execution engines for ML workflows

## Getting Started

To run the pipeline examples:

```bash
# Run all examples
python pipelines/main.py

# Run a specific example
python pipelines/main.py multi_engine
python pipelines/main.py python_udfs
python pipelines/main.py ml_pipeline
python pipelines/main.py yaml_serialization
```

Each example is designed to be minimal yet expressive, showing the elegance and power of xorq's approach to data processing.

## About xorq

xorq is a deferred computational framework that brings the replicability and performance of declarative pipelines to the Python ML ecosystem. It enables us to write pandas-style transformations that never run out of memory, automatically cache intermediate results, and seamlessly move between SQL engines and Python UDFsâ€”all while maintaining replicability.
